D_SETTINGS_USERS_QUICK_EXPLANATION="A contact automatically becomes an attendee once he/she purchases a ticket and completes the payment. Admin staff can make a contact as attendee manually.<br><br>
Public profile can be enabled only for contacts who are attendees or speakers.<br><br>
<b>User roles definitions: </b><br><br>

Contact: Contact can purchase tickets to become attendees, can submit abstracts and reviews.<br><br>

Attendee: Attendee are the ones who are meant to attend the event viz. participants, speakers, moderators, reviewers etc. They can purchase tickets, have public profile, submit abstracts and reviews, log in to their dashboard etc. They're displayed in the Attendee widget on homepage and in the Attendees list.<br><br>

Speaker: Speaker are attendees who are suppose to speak at the event. Like attendee usertype, they can purchase tickets, have public profile, can submit abstracts and reviews. They're also displayed in Speakers widget on the homepage and in the Speakers list.<br><br>

Reviewer: Reviewer are the ones who submit reviews for abstracts assigned to them by an admin. Reviewer can also purchase tickets, submit abstracts etc.<br><br>

Usertypes: are pre-defined usertypes in the system for different roles viz. attendee, speaker, moderator, reviewer and administrator. Usertypes also include custom roles which are associated with custom registration forms. When selecting a usertype to create a user, it automatically selects the associated roles. For example, when creating a user, if you select speaker usertype from the usertype dropdown, the system would automatically select the attendee and speaker roles for this user.<br><br>

Roles: Roles are created to provide access to selected pages to administrator and website users in the backend platform and on the event website respectively. Admin can assign these roles to users with contact and administrator usertypes to provide special access to different sections of the event platform and event website.<br><br>

If browser asks to enter password when saving a user profile, simply remove the password from the password field when clicking on Save. Then, Dryfta would not ask for password. It happens because browsers display saved password for the given URL in the password field. In this case, it is displaying Dryfta backend login password. <br><br>"
